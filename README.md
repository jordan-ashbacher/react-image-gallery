# Project Name

React Image Gallery

## Description

_Duration: 48 Hour Challenge_

This application is created using React to display album artwork in a gallery format. Initial images stored in the database are rendered to the DOM. Inputs allow users to add their own images and descriptions to the gallery. Descriptions can be viewed by clicking on the image and hidden again by clicking on the description container. A "spin" and "remove" button are located beneath each image. Clicking on the spin button updates the text below using conditional rendering to indicated the number of users who are also "spinning the album". The remove button deletes the image from the database along with the corresponding data.
